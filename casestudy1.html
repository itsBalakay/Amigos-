    <h2>Design Brief</h2>
    <p>Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.</p>

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>After finishing my interviews, I noted all the answers and listed them as insights. From these insights, I was able to organize the features I was going to design. All these features were focused on an “experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other, including how to become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees”.</p>
